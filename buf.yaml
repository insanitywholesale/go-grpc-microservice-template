#This is staying on v1beta1
#If buf.yaml is bumped to v1, `build: roots: - proto` is not a thing so we replace it with the following.
#When that's done, we get `proto/v1/hello.proto:9:8:proto/google/api/annotations.proto: does not exist` which is not good.
#Can't find a solution as of now so this is not used.
